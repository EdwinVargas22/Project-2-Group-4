												<h2>Our Findings - Analysis</h2>
												
											</header>


											<section>
												<h3>Covid Cases Before & After Mask Mandate - Line Chart</h3>
												<p>
													The mask mandate was implemented on June 18th which should help us slow the spread of COVID cases but this Line Chart shows it did the opposite. COVID cases just kept increasing and increasing until California became the state with the most COVID cases. It is very alarming and raises a lot of questions if we should really wear face masks but there are many factors that aren’t taken into consideration for example: how often do people clean or use a new face mask, do people wear the face mask properly, or etc. To have a perfect Line Chart that will show if Face Masks are effective or not, we would have to interview a large portion of the population and ask them these kinds of questions. What we do know is COVID could easily spread and we should really take care of ourselves so we don’t become another number in the data.

												<h3>Covid Cases Comparison (Northern California vs. Southern California) - Bubble Chart</h3>
												<p>
													What we learned from the Bubble Chart is, there seems to be a higher concentration of cases around the Bay Area compared to other parts of California but in reality, LA became the epicenter of cases. The Bubble Chart might not reflect it clearly because we divided the radius of the circle by 100,000. If we didn’t do this, there would be a very large circle around LA that would overlap with a good amount of the other circles.

												<h3>Covid Cases Comparison between CA Counties - Scatter Chart</h3>
												<p>
													The scatter plot gives us a better visualization of total numbers of cases between counties in California. This shows LA county had and probably still has a large amount of cases by far compared to the other counties. LA county also had their own mandate which should have helped bring down COVID cases but it didn’t have any effect. The plot doesn’t give us a clear picture because we don’t know if everyone in LA actually wore face masks. One factor could be the population size of LA compared to the other counties. There are more people close together in LA.

												<h3>Conclusion</h3>
												<p>
													We were not able to succeed what our original plan was for the project but what we learned is when the governor issued the masked mandate on June 18th cases and death rates started to rise during the fall and winter season months. During the summer the visualizations demonstrate that the cases have gone down but not by much. It's surprising that the data reflected the opposite of what we thought originally, because we would have thought cases and death rates would either be stable or go down. All in all, we now have many questions and thoughts about the Mask Mandates. Furthermore, as our graphs illustrate, to truly get a handle on this devastating pandemic, it is going to require more than just the government mandates and societal lockdowns; it is going to require the seamless unification of the human race, working in tandem with science while acknowledging the diversity that is inherent in each of our cultural beliefs and norms. Because if we want the various plots and linearrelationships to begin bending and expanding in our favor we have to remember,  it is us against the virus, not us versus our neighbor, a scenario in which the virus thrives.

												<h3>Lessons Learned from this Project</h3>
												<p>
													In this project, we learned that we needed to thoroughly clean the data and set it up exactly how we wanted and needed to use it for each visualization. Many times, we had to go back because we learned it would be easier to set the data up on how we want it exactly than trying to edit the data in the logic.js. We learned the hard way that it is not easy trying to update the date to make it become a timestamp. Our plan was a great idea, but we were faced with many challenges and even though we did not get the outcome we wanted. We did learn so many new things that we did not know before while searching for our answers in google and going through other various realms of obtaining help and new knowledge.

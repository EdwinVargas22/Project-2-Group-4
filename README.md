# Project-2-Group-4

# **Introduction:**

We all know 2020 was a (turbulent / tumultuous) crazy and wild year due to the pandemic.Restaurants had to close, schools had to move to virtual learning, and life itself was turnedupside down for most of us, among many other things. We were told by health officials to wearmasks to stop the spread of COVID and the governor of California implemented a mask mandateon June 18th, 2020. The public, for the most part, followed these mandates, but did they haveany quantifiable data to back them up. That is what we sought out to ascertain -  We wanted tosee if there was a drop in COVID cases and deaths after the mask mandate was implemented.Logic would lead us to believe that there would be a significant drop in  cases and deaths;however, the data told a slightly different story. 


# **Here is what we attempted to answer with this project:**

Did the mask mandate help controlCOVID-19 cases? Did the mandated stay-at-home orders slow the spread? 
What is thepercentage of deaths vs. cases in California? Did Northern California have lower cases thanSouthern California?
